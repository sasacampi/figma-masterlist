Crafted with love (and a lot of cat hair), this project was brought to life through meticulous design in Figma and brought to the web with clean, responsive coding. Whether you're a cat parent or just a fan of great design, Katz is the ultimate spot to spoil your kitty in style. 🐱✨

Before Katz became the sleek, scratch-tastic hub it is today, there was the original version – the design that started it all! 🐱✨

This old-school version of Katz holds a special place in my heart as the foundation for everything that came after. Sure, it’s not my favorite design anymore (we’ve leveled up since then!), but it’s where the vision for a cat-centric e-commerce experience first came to life. Think of it as the "beta" version of Katz – a little rough around the edges, but full of potential and love for our feline friends.

It’s a reminder of how far we’ve come and how much we’ve learned along the way. So here’s to the OG Katz design – the first step in creating a purr-fect destination for cat scratchers! 🖤

Versa was all about sleek, masculine style – from curated fashion to grooming essentials, it was designed to cater to the modern man. While it may not be my most polished work (hey, we all start somewhere!), it was a huge learning experience and a stepping stone in my design and coding journey.
